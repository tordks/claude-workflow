# Development Workflow

Operational protocols for writing, reviewing, and debugging code.

## Before Writing

- Understand existing patterns in codebase
- Identify what principle applies
- Choose the simplest solution that works

## While Writing

- Lint and format after writing code
- Ensure we follow the constitution principles

## When Reviewing

- Correctness: Does it work?
- Clarity: Can you understand it?
- Coverage: Are edge cases handled?
- Consistency: Does it follow existing patterns?

## When Stuck/Ambigous tasks

- Check codebase for similar problems
- Consult official documentation
- Ask before creating new patterns or introducing new principles
- Default to standard solutions
