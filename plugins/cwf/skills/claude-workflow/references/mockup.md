# Mockup Conventions

Create HTML mockups when a feature involves UI/frontend work and visual verification would help confirm understanding.

**Format:** Single HTML file with inline CSS, openable directly in browser.

**Location:** `.cwf/{feature-name}/{feature-name}-mockup.html`

**Plan reference:** Reference mockup inline in Solution Design section where relevant.
