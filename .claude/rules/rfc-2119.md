# RFC 2119 Conformance

CWF specifications use RFC 2119 keywords to indicate requirement levels. This ensures clarity about what is mandatory, recommended, or optional.

## Keyword Definitions

**MUST / MUST NOT** - Absolute requirements or prohibitions. No exceptions.

**SHOULD / SHOULD NOT** - Strong recommendations. May be ignored with valid justification, but implications must be understood.

**MAY** - Truly optional. Implementations can include or omit without needing justification.

## Normative vs Informative Content

Specifications contain two types of content:

**Normative content** - Contains RFC 2119 keywords. Defines actual requirements that implementations must follow.

**Informative content** - Provides context, examples, rationale, or best practices. Does not define requirements.

## Labeling Informative Sections

Always label non-normative content explicitly to prevent confusion:

- Section headers: "(Informative)" suffix
- Inline: "Best Practice:", "Example:", "Note:", "Rationale:"

## Writing Guidelines

1. Use keywords only for actual requirements, not emphasis
2. Be precise - if something is truly required, use MUST; if recommended, use SHOULD
3. Keep normative statements clear and testable
4. Separate rationale from requirements
5. CAPITALIZE keywords consistently (MUST, not must)
